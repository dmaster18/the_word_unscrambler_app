# the_word_unscrambler
 
The Word Unscrambler is a game created using the JavaScript React framework. It allows users to play a game where they need to create as many words as possible within 3 minutes from a random assortment of nine letters. Users with especially high scores can feel free to post their high scores to the app's leaderboard.

Users cannot use any letter tile more than once when forming a new word. When a user enters a word, the game will inform him whether the word is correct or incorrect.
